Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is defined as persistently elevated blood pressure above 130/80 mmHg. 
Lifestyle modifications are first-line therapy: reduced sodium intake, regular physical activity, weight management, 
and limiting alcohol. 
When medication is needed, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, thiazide diuretics, or calcium channel blockers are commonly used. 
Treatment choice depends on comorbidities such as diabetes or chronic kidney disease.
